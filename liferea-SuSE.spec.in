An Aggregator For RSS/RDF Feeds For GTK/GNOME.                                                                          

Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader. It is a news
aggregator for online news feeds. It supports a number of different
feed formats including RSS/RDF, CDF, Atom, OCS, and OPML. There are
many other news readers available, but these others are not available
for Linux or require many extra libraries to be installed. Liferea
tries to fill this gap by creating a fast, easy to use, easy to
install news aggregator for GTK/GNOME.
