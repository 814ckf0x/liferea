Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader. It is a news
aggregator for online news feeds. It supports a number of different
feed formats including RSS/RDF, CDF, Atom, OCS, and OPML. There are
many other news readers available, but these others are not available
for Linux or require many extra libraries to be installed. Liferea
tries to fill this gap by creating a fast, easy to use, easy to
install news aggregator for GTK/GNOME.

This documentation was last updated for Liferea version 0.4.8.

  NOTE THAT 0.4.8 BREAKS DOWNWARD COMPATIBILITY. PLEASE READ
        THE "UPGRADING TO NEWER VERSIONS" SECTION.

Installation
============

To install Liferea you can either get a package for your 
Linux distribution or try to compile and install Liferea
from the Source Tarball. In the following you will find
short hints for several platforms. See below to find
how to compile the tarball.

Debian:		Beginning with version 0.4.3 there are officially
		build packages maintained by Christophe Barbe.

RedHat/		Please ensure you have a libxml2 version
Fedora:		at least 2.5.10 or you will experience nasty
		segfaults. 

		Fedora Core 1 packages for 0.4.7 and 0.4.8 are available from
		http://download.fedora.us/fedora/fedora/1/i386/RPMS.testing/.
		
		Dag Wieers provides 0.4.8 packages for both 
                Fedora Core 1 and 2 which can be found at 
                http://dag.wieers.com/packages/liferea/.
		
SuSE:		Since 0.4.6 Harry Auschner builds packages for
		SuSE i586 which are available from the SourceForge
		project page.

Gentoo:		There is an ebuild available at:

		http://www.breakmygentoo.net/ebuilds/

FreeBSD:	There are Liferea packages (built by Hye-Shik Chang) at
		
		http://www.freshports.org/net/liferea/

Fink		The Fink project also supports Liferea:

		http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/liferea
		
Slackware	Since 0.4.7 Dario Conigliaro builds Slackwares
		tarballs. These are available from the SourceForge
		project page.
	

Compiling from Source
=====================
		
If you want you can compile Liferea. Download the tarball from 
the SourcForge project page and extract with: 

   tar zxvf liferea-0.4.8.tar.gz 

Of course you should adjust the filename. After unpacking 
run the standard autotools commands: 

   ./configure
   make
   make install		


Upgrading to newer versions
===========================

If you upgrade from 0.1 to 0.2 you will loose your feed list (but you may 
correct this by creating a gconf string list named "feedlist" and adding all
feed key names to it).

Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.2.5 till 0.3.0 should not harm the feed list.

Upgrading from the non-auto updating version (all versions below 0.3.0)
should be no problem. The non existing upgrade interval will be interpreted
as auto updating is disabled. To enable use the feed properties dialog.

Upgrading from 0.3.0 or below to 0.3.1 which introduces folder should
be possible without problems. All subscribed feeds will appear in the
folder "my feeds".

When upgrading to 0.4.0 the OCS directory cache format changes. The
program 'll automatically update all OCS directories. Please be
patient while downloading.

When upgrading to 0.4.8 the cache directory structure and the save 
mechanism of the feed list will be changed. After the automatic
conversion older versions of Liferea cannot read the cache anymore
and the won't see the converted feed list anymore. To be prepared
for problems please export the feed list using the older version
of Liferea! In case of problems you can reinstall the older version
and import the backup feed list.

Dependencies
============

The library dependencies for gtk2, gconf2, gtkhtml2, libxml2 and 
others are all set to 2.0.0. Maybe they could be more specific...

There is a special issue with RedHat based distributions: you 
have to install at least libxml2 2.5.10 or you will occur 
random segfaults.

Help Wanted
===========

If you want to help please subscribe to the liferea-devel mailing 
list available on the SourceForge project page. After each release
we discuss new tasks to be done. Just join the discussion!
