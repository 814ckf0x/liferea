Note: This program is under heavy development :)

Upgrading to newer versions
===========================

If you upgrade from 0.1 to 0.2 you will loose your feed list (but you may 
correct this by creating a gconf string list named "feedlist" and adding all
feed key names to it).

Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.2.5 till 0.3.0 should not harm the feed list.

Upgrading from the non-auto updating version (all versions below 0.3.0)
should be no problem. The non existing upgrade interval will be interpreted
as auto updating is disabled. To enable use the feed properties dialog.

Upgrading from 0.3.0 or below to 0.3.1 which introduces folder should
be possible without problems. All subscribed feeds will appear in the
folder "my feeds".

Dependencies
============

The library dependencies for gtk2, gconf2, gtkhtml2, libxml2 and 
others are all set to 2.0.0. Maybe they could be more specific...

Help
====

As you can see in the code I'm not that experienced
programmer, so I would appreciate any help!

Known Problems
==============

- pressing Shift-Tab in the main window item list twice crashes
  immediatly
- Item/Channel Titles with HTML-tags are not correctly parsed,
  all text in enclosing tags is lost
- feed property changing in main window feed list behaves
  strange -> thus deactivated
- no matter which item is clicked first, after a feed was reloaded
  always the item AND the first item is marked as unread
- the program specifies no user agent when accessing feed urls
- heavy memory usage (e.g. 15 feeds -> 2MB program memory) and
  theres still no cleanup of old data on updates!
