This documentation was last updated for Liferea version 0.3.7.

Installation
============

Debian:		You have two choices: either download a package
		from the sourceforge project page (these packages
		are built by Joern Seemann) or you use the installation
		sources provided by Rex Tsai. To do so add the following 
		lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list:
		
			deb http://kalug.linux.org.tw/~chihchun/debian unstable liferea
			deb-src http://kalug.linux.org.tw/~chihchun/debian unstable liferea		

RedHat:		Please ensure you have a libxml2 version
		at least 2.5.10 or you will experience nasty
		segfaults. You can download RPM packages
		from the sourceforge project page. If you
		have dependency problems try the "--nodeps"
		option.
		
SuSE:		You can download RPM packages built on SuSE 8.1
		from the sourceforge project page.

FreeBSD:	There are Liferea packages (built by Hye-Shik Chang) at
		
		http://www.freshports.org/net/liferea/

Upgrading to newer versions
===========================

If you upgrade from 0.1 to 0.2 you will loose your feed list (but you may 
correct this by creating a gconf string list named "feedlist" and adding all
feed key names to it).

Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.2.5 till 0.3.0 should not harm the feed list.

Upgrading from the non-auto updating version (all versions below 0.3.0)
should be no problem. The non existing upgrade interval will be interpreted
as auto updating is disabled. To enable use the feed properties dialog.

Upgrading from 0.3.0 or below to 0.3.1 which introduces folder should
be possible without problems. All subscribed feeds will appear in the
folder "my feeds".

Dependencies
============

The library dependencies for gtk2, gconf2, gtkhtml2, libxml2 and 
others are all set to 2.0.0. Maybe they could be more specific...

There is a special issue with RedHat based distributions: you 
have to install at least libxml2 2.5.10 or you will occur 
random segfaults.

Help Wanted
===========

As you can see in the code I'm not that experienced
programmer, so I would appreciate any help!

Known Problems
