This documentation was last updated for Liferea version 0.4.5.

Installation
============

To install Liferea you can either get a package for your 
Linux distribution or try to compile and install Liferea
from the Source Tarball. In the following you will find
short hints for several platforms. See below to find
how to compile the tarball.

Debian:		Beginning with version 0.4.3 there are officially
		build packages maintained by Christophe Barbe.

RedHat/		Please ensure you have a libxml2 version
Fedora:		at least 2.5.10 or you will experience nasty
		segfaults. You can download RPM packages
		from the sourceforge project page. If you
		have dependency problems try the "--nodeps"
		option.
		
		You can download Fedora packages maintained by
		Phillip Compton from
		
		http://download.fedora.us/fedora/redhat/0.95/i386/RPMS.testing
		
SuSE:		Since 0.4.6 Harry Auschner builds packages for
		SuSE i586 which are available from the SourceForge
		project page.

Gentoo:		There is an ebuild available at:

		http://www.breakmygentoo.net/ebuilds/

FreeBSD:	There are Liferea packages (built by Hye-Shik Chang) at
		
		http://www.freshports.org/net/liferea/

Fink		The Fink project also covers Liferea:

Compiling from Source
=====================
		
If you want you can compile Liferea. Download the tarball from 
the SourcForge project page and extract with: 

   tar zxvf liferea-0.3.8.tar.gz 

Of course you should adjust the filename. After unpacking 
run the standard autotools commands: 

   ./configure
   make
   make install		


Upgrading to newer versions
===========================

If you upgrade from 0.1 to 0.2 you will loose your feed list (but you may 
correct this by creating a gconf string list named "feedlist" and adding all
feed key names to it).

Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.2.5 till 0.3.0 should not harm the feed list.

Upgrading from the non-auto updating version (all versions below 0.3.0)
should be no problem. The non existing upgrade interval will be interpreted
as auto updating is disabled. To enable use the feed properties dialog.

Upgrading from 0.3.0 or below to 0.3.1 which introduces folder should
be possible without problems. All subscribed feeds will appear in the
folder "my feeds".

When upgrading to 0.4.0 the OCS directory cache format changes. The
program 'll automatically update all OCS directories. Please be
patient while downloading.

Dependencies
============

The library dependencies for gtk2, gconf2, gtkhtml2, libxml2 and 
others are all set to 2.0.0. Maybe they could be more specific...

There is a special issue with RedHat based distributions: you 
have to install at least libxml2 2.5.10 or you will occur 
random segfaults.

Help Wanted
===========

As you can see in the code I'm not that experienced
programmer, so I would appreciate any help!

Known Problems
