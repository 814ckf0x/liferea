Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader. It is a news
aggregator for online news feeds. It supports a number of different
feed formats including RSS/RDF, CDF, Atom, OCS, and OPML. There are
many other news readers available, but these others are not available
for Linux or require many extra libraries to be installed. Liferea
tries to fill this gap by creating a fast, easy to use, easy to
install news aggregator for GTK/GNOME.

This documentation was last updated for Liferea version 1.0.

Installation
============

To install Liferea you can either get a package for your 
Linux distribution or try to compile and install Liferea
from the Source Tarball. In the following you will find
short hints for several platforms. See below to find
how to compile the tarball.

Debian:		Beginning with version 0.4.3 there are officially
		build packages maintained by Christophe Barbe. With
		0.6.1 David Moreno Garza is the new Debian maintainer.
		To install Liferea run:

		   apt-get install liferea

RedHat/		For FC 3 and 4 you can install Liferea from the 
Fedora:		Extras repositories. Just run:

		   yum install liferea

		Dag Wieers provides packages for both Fedora which
		can be found at http://dag.wieers.com/packages/liferea/.
		
SuSE:		Until 0.6.0 Harry Auschner built SuSE RPMs available at the 
                SourceForge project page. For newer releases please visit this 
		package repository maintained by Pascal Bleser. There you will 
		find packages for SuSE 9.2, 9.1, 9.0 and 8.2. It is also 
		available via APT. The packages can be found at:
		
		http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/suser-guru/rpm/packages/Network/liferea/

		Since 10.1 SuSE seems to have an own Liferea package.

Gentoo:		There is an ebuild available at:

		http://www.breakmygentoo.net/ebuilds/

FreeBSD:	There are Liferea packages (built by Hye-Shik Chang) at
		
		http://www.freshports.org/net/liferea/

Fink		The Fink project also supports Liferea:

		http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/liferea
		
Slackware	Since 0.4.7 Dario Conigliaro builds Slackwares
		tarballs. These are available from the SourceForge
		project page.

Solaris		Since 0.9.2 there are Solaris packages built
                be Jeremy Teo. This package was built to work 
                with the Solaris gtk2,libxml2,gconf2 and 
                libgtkhtml packages from blastwave.org.

Browser Integration
===================

Liferea allows direct subscriptions from Firefox 1.5+
and Epiphany. Epiphany provides a standard plugin that
allows adding subscription directly to Liferea.

If you want to subscribe from within Firefox you need
to install an extension manually. Although there are
several extensions that might do the task one called
"FeedBag" is supplied with the source tarball. To
install it open feedbag.xpi from the source root
directory with Firefox. This should start the 
installation procedure. Once installed clicking the
live bookmark icon should add subscriptions to Liferea.
	

Compiling from Source
=====================
		
If you want you can compile Liferea. Download the tarball from 
the SourcForge project page and extract with: 

   tar zxvf liferea-1.0.tar.gz 

Of course you should adjust the filename. After unpacking 
run the standard autotools commands: 

   ./configure
   make
   make install		


Dependencies
============

The library dependencies for Liferea are: gtk2, gconf2, libxml2
and either libgtkembedmoz or gtkhtml2.

If you want to use the Mozilla browser module you need a Mozilla
installation containing libgtkembedmoz.so. Every up-to-date Firefox
should bring it.
