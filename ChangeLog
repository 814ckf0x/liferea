2005-08-??  ???  <???> 

	Version 0.9.7

	* Added "copy link location" to item list context
	  menu. Patch #1175756 from Adam Flanczewski.
	* Single key navigation patch #1211774 from an 
	  anonymous contributor. This allows keyboard
	  navigation (u,d,f,b) when using GtkHTML2, but
	  due to a focussing problem it is not really 
	  usable with Mozilla.

	Bugfixes:

	* Closing the search dialog with the window
	  manager don't causes crashes anymore.
	* Preference dialog cannot be opened multiple
	  times anymore.
	* Fixes missing links in item display with Mozilla
	  reported by Rich Daley. (SF bug #1255253)
	* Prevents "next-unread" to select items within
	  a vfolder, except if a vfolder is selected
	  reported by Sigge Kotliar. (SF #1252034)

	* Changed the Liferea startup options to allow Liferea's mainwindow
	  to startup in hidden or iconified mode ( --mainwindow-state ).
	* Preliminary Atom 1.0 feed support.
	* Documentation is now stored locally. It is a set of HTML 
          files accessed through the help menu.

	Bugfixes:
	
	* Fix a crash when a HTML form was used with GtkHTML2. 
          (SF bug #1166159).

	Bugfixes:

	* Fixes #1188688 which broke prevented allowing
	  you to manually specify enclosure download
	  commands. Reported by lostyack.
	* Fixes #891604 reported by Niklas Morberg. Now
	  "Next Unread" really selects the next unread
	  item and not the first one from the beginning
	  of the feed list.
	* Performance improvements for condensed mode in some cases.
	  (Nathan conrad)
	* Fix bug #1073561 where the mouse wheel could make the main

	* Improvements to the URL passing when launching links 
          in a configured external browser (Nathan Conrad)

	  new item counter.
	* When deleting a feed the last visible feed or item

	* The search box was changed to a search dialog to avoid
	  user confusion about the search scope.
	* Searching is now case insensitive.
	* Added a menu option to create a new vfolder.
	* The texts in the preferences dialog were somewhat

	* Fixes bug 1169518, which crashed when a vfolder item
	  the user has selected was dropped from the source
	  feeds cache.

2005-01-15  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.9.0
	
	* Removal of a lot old migration code. Don't upgrade 
	  directly from versions below 0.6.x or you might loose
	  some of your preferences. If you upgrade from very old
	  version like 0.4.x you might even loose your feed list.
	  To properly upgrade install the latest 0.6.x release,
	  run it at least once and then upgrade to 0.9.x.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Experimental support for HTML entities when parsing
	  XML. This is to workaround the various broken feeds.
	  Note: only very common HTML entities are supported.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* GTK+ dependency raised to 2.4 to drop the included
	  GtkTreeModelFilter source. (Lars Lindner)
	* Filtered feed list feature removed. Did not work
	  properly and there is no time to fix it.
	* Added link to FeedValidator in the feed syntax error
	  messages. (Nathan Conrad)

	Bugfixes:

	* Fix for crash when deleting feed while favicon
	  gets updated. (Jakub W. Jozwicki)
	* Preventing password exposal in status line when	
	  updating favicons. (reported by Ben Winslow)
	* Fixes broken saving of sorting order.
	* Fixes a bug that could prevent browser launching
	  for all asynchronously called browser commands.
	* Fix for crash when a URL with a space character
	  is added to the feedlist. (Nathan Conrad)
	* The notification window is now moved to the upper left of the
	  screen before it is shown so that the user does not see the
	  notification window move. (Søren Hansen)
	* The network library now correctly tries to connect to all hosts
	  that share a domain name. This helps on some IPv6 enabled
	  computers. (Sjoerd Simons and Nathan Conrad)
	* Atom feed elements that are of type "text/plain" are now
	  displayed as text instead of as HTML. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Fixed a problem with the new item counter of 
	  the systray icon. (Lars Lindner)
        * Clicking on a vfolder and then an item in the vfolder now

	Version 0.6.4
	
	* Added Polish translation and default feed list. 
          (Jakub W. Jozwicki)
	* Article skimming keybinding is now global. 
          (Lars Lindner)

	  This should solve proxy problems on Solaris.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Fixes a bug that caused the items of a deleted feed 
	  not to be removed from all vfolders. 
	  (Jakub W. Jozwicki)
	* Workaround for unwanted GtkHTML2 default background
	  color. Liferea now enforces a white background.

2004-11-25  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.6.3
	
	* Keyboard focus is adjusted on "Next Unread".
	  (Lars Lindner)

	* 100% CPU usage on HTTP 202 (e.g. Slashdot after 
	  banning) is now fixed. (Oliver Feiler)
	* Fixes a possible crash when selecting the condensed
	  mode view. (Jakub W. Jozwicki)
	  

2004-11-14  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.6.2
	
	* Liferea now supports cookies. Contrary to previous
	  statements the SnowNews code to realize this was 
	  included but not used. To use this feature place 
	  a cookies.txt in ~/.liferea. The format of this 
	  file is the format Netscape introduced for cookie
	  files. (Lars Lindner)
	* Liferea now enforces umask 0077 when saving the
	  feed list to ensure your passwords are not group
	  or world accessible. In this context please check
	  the permissions of your ~/.liferea directory.
	  Older program versions might have created the 
	  directory with unnecessary priviledges. Current
	  versions (0.6.x) create the directory only with
	  user priviledges. Thanks to the reporters Nick Rout 
	  and Eric Gregory! (Lars Lindner)
	* Bugfix for a crash when double-clicking a "(empty)"
	  entry in empty folders. Reported by Martin Sarfy.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* If a feed uses HTTP authentication the user and
	  password isn't displayed in the feed description
	  anymore. (Lars Lindner)

2004-10-31  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.6.1
	
	* Changed the handling of updated items. Previously the
	  read status of updated items was set to unread. This
	  was very inconvenient because of a lot of buggy feeds
	  with non-unique item ids which caused continuously
	  unread but unchanged items. Now an update flag is set
	  and the item is shown in bold dark gray color in the
	  item list. An updated item does not count in the
	  unread counter anymore. 
	  I hope this improves usability with broken feeds.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Finally made the condensed mode a permanent feed state.
	  Just select it once and the feed you like to read in 
	  this mode will stay this way until you switch it off.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Improvement to the itemlist viewing mode switching.
	  Now the HTML rendering widget isn't destroyed each
	  time the mode is switched but reused.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* IPv6 Support. (Christoph Hohmann)
	* Support for broken web-servers and proxies that use
	  chunked encoding. (Alex Myltsev)
	* A feed update now does not reset the item list focus
	  or selection anymore. (Lars Lindner)
	* Applied HIG rule for "..." in menu labels.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Changed "New Subscription" menu icon to "+" sign
	  like it is in the toolbar. (Bram Senders)
	* Added a Technorati link like Sage has. (Lars Lindner)
	* The feed description of a subscription with a command
	  as source does not show the command string anymore.
	  This is to avoid showing sensitive information.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Liferea now has a global feed update interval setting.
	  This setting defines the update behaviour of a feed
	  for which neither you or the feed provider did define
	  a feed specific update interval. There is also a new
	  option in the feed properties to disable automatic
	  updates of the feed. (Lars Lindner)
	* Added a button in the preferences to force an update
          of all feed favicons. (Amit D. Chaudhary)
	
	Bugfixes:

	* Liferea now prevents the update of vfolders when you
	  request the update of all feeds. This bug changed the
	  vfolder state to unavailable. (Lars Lindner)
	* Fix for a HTML layout problem where big images could
	  misalign the item footer and following items.
	  (Gee Law)
	* Finally corrected the inverted sorting order of
	  the date column. But this means that you have to
	  reset the sort order of all your feeds once. Sorry
	  about that! (Lars Lindner)
	* The handling of the default update interval information
	  of feeds was broken so the properties dialog never 
	  showed the value. This is fixed now. (Lars Lindner)
	* Fixed a bug on with non-blocking sockets and Solaris8.
	  (pkeusem)

2004-09-15  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.6.0
	
	* Finally added a menu option to remove a single item.
	  Sorry that it took so long! (Lars Lindner)
	* Item modification times are now correctly converted to the local
	  timezone. (Nathan Conrad)
	* The help feeds are now (almost) normal subscriptions 
	  and can be removed and modified. The only remaining
	  difference is that the version in the URL is updated
	  automatically and that old items are dropped. This
	  also removes the special icon of the help folder.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Removed the ugly unavailable icon. Now the GNOME stock
	  icon for the error dialog is used. (Lars Lindner)
	* Added a default feed list that is installed upon the
	  first program start. Added a Spanish localized version
	  by Topopardo. (Lars Lindner)
	* Added support for reading subscriptions URLs from 
	  a named pipe (~/.liferea/new_subscription) to allow
	  external programs to add feeds. (Lars Lindner)
	* Itemlist sorting order is now saved on a per-feed basis.
	  (Nathan Conrad)
	* Experimental vfolder implementation. When you do a search
	  you now can save the search result as a vfolder. There
	  is still a lot to do but just play around and write us
	  your opinion! (Lars Lindner)
	  
	Bugfixes:
	
	* Fixed a bug that caused a crash when right clicking the
	  feed list in filtered mode. (Lars Lindner)
	* Fixed a problem with the session managment registering
	  which prevented the usage of the Mozilla browser module.
	  (Nathan Conrad)
	* Iconification state is saved between sessions. (Nathan Conrad)
	* URLs are now stripped of leading and trailing
	  whitespace. (Nathan Conrad)
	
2004-08-31  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.de>

	Version 0.5.3c
	
	* Update of the Italian translation (Dario Conigliaro)

	* Update of the Czech translation (Juraj Kubelka)
	* Updated RPM spec file. (Daniel Resare)
	* Update of the French translation (Vincent Lefevre)
	
	Bugfixes:

	* Fixed HTTP authentication problem with case sensitivy 
	  in the HTTP headers. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Fixed gaim strings in the configure output reported by 
	  Russell Kaiser. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Corrected dependency for libxml2 from 2.0 to 2.4.1 for the
	  configure script and allow older versions of gconf. (Nathan
	  Conrad)
	* Removed accidental usage of libxml2 2.6 usage. Liferea should
	  now work with libxml2 2.4.1 or newer. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Fixed a mistake in the German translation. (Lars Lindner)
	* Fixed a bug that prevented RSS content:encoded tags
	  to be parsed. (Lars Lindner)
	
2004-08-16  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.5.3
	
	* New File selectors are used when compiled with GTK+ 2.4 or
	  later. (Nathan Conrad)
	* XML parsers now detect namespaces based on their URL. (Nathan
	  Conrad)
	* UTF-16 formatted documents are now supported. Please complain if
	  you have problems! This may also help other encodings that
	  contain NULL bytes in their datastreams.
	* More favicons are now detected (HTML pages are now searched for
	  links to the favicons). (Nathan Conrad)
	* Authenticated proxies are now supported via the GNOME proxy
	  settings and http_proxy environment variable. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Help feeds are no longer downloaded at every startup.
	* Support for photo blog RSS modules. (Lars Lindner)
	* There is a new preference option in the "Headline Display"
	  tab to change the key binding for skimming through the
	  articles. It now defaults to Ctrl-Space instead of simply
	  Space. This is to allow using forms with Mozilla. If you
	  prefer Space please set it explicitly in the preferences.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* GConf schemas have been added to document the various gconf
	  keys that Liferea uses and provide control of defaults by
	  computer administrators. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Notification popups now show the favicon of the feeds for
	  easier recognizing. (Lars Linder)
	* Session manager support. This makes the lock file removed when
	  a user logs out without first cloning Liferea. (Lots of code from
	  gaim, but integrated into Liferea by Nathan Conrad)
	  
	Bugfixes:

	* Fixed bug where some invalid feeds were causing their item lists
	  to be erased when they were updated. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Fixed bug that may crash the program when the libxml2 error
	  output displayed in the feed description contains invalid
	  Unicode characters. This was reported by Yanko Kaneti.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	* Fixed bug with incorrect HTML in the condensed mode. 
	  (Jack Lecou)
	* Fixed the missing scrolling reset when you display items
	  with Mozilla (Lars Lindner)
	* Fixed a popup menu problems with gtkhtml2, which did not 
	  always show the correct menu reported by hakon_g.
	  (Lars Lindner)
	
2004-08-02 Lars Linder <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.5.2c

	* Update of the Czech translation. (Juraj Kubelka)
	
	Bugfixes:
	
	* Fixes a bug reported by twentyone that hides the headers 
	  and metadata when the two pane mode (condensed view) is 
	  enabled. (Lars Lindner)
	* Favicons downloaded using gzip compression are no longer
	  corrupted. This might fix some other download problems. 
	  (Nathan Conrad)
	* Fixed a parsing bug that treated Atom feed modified/issued
	  dates as RFC822 instead of ISO6801 dates. (Lars Lindner)
	* Fix parsing of atom feeds that do not escape their content.
	  (Nathan Conrad)
