	* Simple news bin support. You can create news
	  bins and add items from the item list context
	  menu. Items in news bins are kept permanently.
	* HTML based item menu in combined mode. This
	  allows social bookmarking from combined mode
	  too.

	Version 1.1.5 (Unstable)

	* Experimental scripting support. From the main menu
	  you can open a "Script Manager" dialog where you
	  can add LUA scripts for some hook types. This adds
	  an optional LUA dependency.
	* No-Proxy support. Now the feed properties and the
	  advanced subscription dialog provide a no-proxy
	  option.

	* Fixes rendering and function of the broken search
	  feature. (reported by Sergei Butakov)
	* Added a new feed property that allows to automatically
	  load the item link instead of the item contents.
	* The feed cache now stores the original subscription
	  URL for each feed. So after redirecting accidents one
	  could restore it. For migration the current source URL
	  is used as the original source. Currently there is no
	  GUI function to restore those URLs.
	* Fixes SF #1357891 which is about incorrect merging for
	  feeds that provide more items than the configured cache
	  size. Now the items to be merged are truncated before
	  merging. (reported by Rich Daley and others)
	* Fixes entering periods into URL entries in tabs.
	* Removes the old locking code and replaces it with the
	  libbacon message connection. This gets rid of the 
	  annoying "lock file found" dialog and just raises
	  a running instance. Note that this might not work with
	  multipe X servers and in networked environments.
	* Replaced the flag icon with the GNOME stock icon for
	  'important'. Also updated the 'unread' icon from the
	  GNOME 2.14 stock.
	* The item list now displays an additional column at the
	  second position if one of the currently displayed items
	  has an enclosure. For each item with an enclosure the
	  'attachment' symbol (copied from GNOME stock) is 
	  displayed.

	  created by Chris Pirillo.

	  unselecting when browsing folder with "hide read
          items" enabled.
	* The status bar now presents the number of new and
	  unread headlines (Frederic Peter).
	* Rendering is now done using XSLT. This introduces
	  a dependency to libxslt.

	  was dropped. The reason were problems when 
	  rendering XHTML and using Flash applets.
