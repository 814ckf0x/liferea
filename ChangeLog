2004-??-?? ???

	Version 0.5.1
	
	* Favicons are now processed with gdkpixbuf and saved
	  to disc in PNG format. This should save some disk space
	  and now supports image with 24bit colors and sizes other
	  than 16x16. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Now a short help text is displayed in the HTML view
	  after startup.
	  
	Bugfixes:
	  
	* When URLs are passed to an external browser they are
	  now escaped correctly. (Lars Lindner)
	* When a feed could not be downloaded after the 
	  subscription it was missing a cache file. This caused
	  an error message each time the program starts. This
	  is fixed now. (Lars Lindner)
	* Debian bug 254959 reported by Martin-Aric Racine was
	  fixed. No Liferea recognizes RSS 1.0 Creative Commons
	  license information.

	Version 0.5.0
	
	* New Russian translation (Alekseev Vladimir)
	* New Czech translation (Juraj Kubelka)
	* Feed Link Autodiscovery, this means you can subscribe
	  to any website's and the feed link is determined 
	  automatically. (ahmed el-helw)
	* Mozilla browser module supports zooming now. (Lars Lindner)
	* Scroll down or next unread feature for Mozilla, and is now triggered 
	  by space instead of shift-space.
	* Improved HTML stylesheet. This will cause current items to be
	  duplicated the first time that 0.5.0 is run.
	* Relative links in HTML plugins are now supported.
	* HTML plugin interface has changed.
	* Added news reader icon drawn by Jakob Steiner as recommended
	  application launcher icon.
	* Added a simple manual page.
	* The feed downloading now is concurrent to avoid long waiting
	  times on timeouts or slow feed sources. The default concurrency
	  is 3. The value can be configured by setting the gconf key
	  /apps/liferea/update-thread-concurrency
	* Scheduled feed updates are calculated based on the time of the
	  last poll of the feed, which is saved across restarts of
	  Liferea. This means that feeds needing updates (based on the
	  update interval) are automatically updated when Liferea starts.
	* If the close box is used in the Liferea main window when the
	  systray icon is active, Liferea will close its main window, but
	  not quit. Click the systray icon to show the main window
	
	Bug Fixes:
	
	* "Select file" works when adding a "command" source in the feed
	  properties.
	* Liferea should now build with gcc 2.95 again.
	* Toolbars now obey the GNOME toolbar setting with respect to if
	  icons, text, or both are desired to be shown.
	  
2004-05-22  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.9

	* New button in the statusbar to work offline. (Lars Lindner)
	* New Properties dialog box. Cache settings can now be set
	  per-feed. The "New Feed" dialog was also changed. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Conversion filters are now supported. This allows web sites to
	  be converted to feeds using special conversion scripts. (Nathan
	  Conrad)
	* Feed menu is re-organised. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Feed type autodetection has been rewritten. It should be better
	  than the old version. Thus, the manual feed type selection has
	  been removed. (Nathan Conrad)
	* The contents of a folder can now be updated by right-clicking a
	  folder and selecting "Update". (Nathan Conrad)
	* Support for using old versions of GConf2 has been re-added. This
	  fixes compile problems on many RedHat versions. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Marked items are now always saved. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Recursive updating and deleting of folders has been added. These
	  can be accessed via the "Feeds" menu and via the feedlist
	  contextual menus. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Toolbar items have been re-arranged, and two items have been
	  added. (Nathan Conrad)
	* Makefile/configure changes including a patch found on the Polish
	  Linux Distribution web page.
	* Stylesheet improvements (delusional)
	* The Mozilla browser module now supports two and three pane
          mode. (Lars Lindner)
	* Added a preference which determines whether a link is opened
	  inside the applications HTML widget or with the configured
	  external browser. Of course this is only possible if the
	  browser module supports inside browsing. Currently only
	  Mozilla does. GtkHTML2 will ignore the option. (Lars Lindner)
	
2004-05-06  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.8

	* A lot of rewrites. Everywhere! Lots of bug fixes too.
	* Rewrite of the feedlist tree handling. The program
	  now allows arbitrary nested folders. You can now
	  drag and drop folders.
	* Rewrite and change of the feedlist saving method.
	  Now the feedlist isn't saved into gconf but into
	  an OPML file in the cache directory. This allows
	  one to easily backup one's feedlist and cache by
	  archiving the settings directory ~/.liferea. It
	  also allows exchanging subscriptions with other
	  aggregators without depending on the program
	  to export the list by directly manipulating the
	  ~/.liferea/feedlist.opml file.
	  
	      !!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	     THIS CHANGE BREAKS DOWNWARD COMPATIBILITY.
	    ONCE YOU'VE RUN 0.4.8, THE FEEDLIST CANNOT
	      BE READ BY OLDER VERSIONS OF LIFEREA!

 	      !!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	
	  To be prepared for problems during the conversion
	  you should export the feedlist using the last
	  installed version!
	* Change of the cache file naming scheme. Now
	  random filenames are generated.
	* New Feed Auto Saving feature. To avoid data loss
	  on program crashes or forced shutdown changed
	  feeds are automatically saved all 5 minutes.
	* Also only changed feeds are saved during feed saves. 
	  Formerly every feed was saved.
	* Improved OPML support. Redundant attributes when
	  exporting to provide wider compatibility with
	  other aggregators. More information is now exported.
	* The broken searching was fixed by Nathan Conrad.
	* Added Italian translation done by Dario Conigliaro.
	* Added Traditional Chinese translation by Rex Tsai.
	* Updated RPM spec file from Brian Pepple.

2004-04-28  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.7d
	
	* Fix from Nathan Conrad to prevent a cache loading
	  crash reported by Brian Pepple.
	* Fix from Nathan Conrad to prevent random crashes 
	  when viewing items. This should fix a lot of 
	  problems reported. Especially problems with
	  non ASCII feeds!
	* Added an Italian translation from Dario Conigliaro.
	
2004-04-21  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.7c
	
	* Added patch from Ed Catmur to fix bug 934785 which
	  caused the a locale switch to "C" as soon
	  as a RFC822 date was parsed.
	* Added patch from Christophe Barbe to fix bug 934326
	  which caused crashes when using piped commands as 
	  feed source.
	* Fixes a crash when parsing RSS module tags reported
	  by Guillaume Morin and Christophe Barbe.
	* Fixes bug 938278 which caused an unwanted asserting
	  when parsing invalid HTML.
	* When headlines are updated the new headline time
	  overwrites the old headline date.

2004-04-11  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.7b

	* Added a Macedonian translation from Tomislav Markovski.
	* Upgrade to an improved version of the SnowNews
	  networking code from Oliver Feiler. The new
	  code now supports basic and digest HTTP
	  authentication. This should satisfy change
	  request 932183 from Eric Gregory.
	* Fixes drag&drop crash reported with patch
	  931558 from morberg.
	* Fixes a thread safety problem which caused
	  wrong download results. A patch to fix this
	  was provided by Oliver Feiler.
	* Fixes a double free when loading feeds.

2004-04-07  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.7

	* This version contains a lot of rewrites
	  from Nathan J. Conrad and me. I expect a
	  lot of problems to come up. Please fall
	  back to the last version if you have
	  serious problems! Or simply wait for the
	  first corrections releases :)
	* The program now loads a configured HTML
	  view widget plugin. There is a GtkHTML
	  plugin which should work as before. There
	  is an experimental Mozilla plugin too. To 
	  easily find the needed Mozilla libraries 
	  the program binary is now called "liferea-bin" 
	  and their is a script "liferea" which tries
	  to correctly set up the library paths.
	* When you change a feed URL the feed is
	  now updated automatically after closing
	  the properties dialog.
	* Added the previously removed proxy dialog
	  as I decided Liferea should stay a GTK
	  application (but Søren Hansen told me he
	  wants to do GNOME integration so this may
	  come as a compile option). So users without
	  GNOME (maybe KDE) can easily set a proxy.
	* Added a patch (882761) from morberg.
	* Added a preferences checkbox to disable the 
	  automatical adding of the help feeds.
	* Added a patch from Nathan J. Conrad to make
	  the preferences dialog instant applying
	  each option. This way its more GNOME HIG 
	  compliant.
	* Added a patch from Christophe Barbe to change
	  the tray icon behaviour to come up on the
	  current desktop.
	* Simplification of the namespace support code,
	  which fixes some memory leaks.
	* Patch from Nathan J. Conrad and Roshan Revankar
	  to simplify the GTK selection handling and 
	  fix some problems with Copy URL.
	* Changed the dialog button order to be more
	  GNOME HIG compliant (proposed by delusional).
	  But once again: I really don't like it that way!
	* The program now remembers the itemlist mode.
	* The program now remembers the HTML views zoom level.
	* Changed the menu/toolbar checkboxes to a radiobutton
	  list with positive logic.

2004-03-12  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.6e

	* Fixes a crash when parsing feeds using the
	  blogChannel RSS module reported on the Debian
	  bug tracker (237306).
	* Includes a UTF-8 version of the bulgarian 
	  translation created by Vladimir Petkov. The
	  last version contained one in ISO-8859
	  which is not supported by GTK.
	  
2004-03-03  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.6d

	* Fixes a bug concerning encoding conversion which was
	  reported by Niklas Morberg with Patch 908949.
	* Fixes bug 908803: problems with a webserver which
	  supports deflate compression reported by Nathan J. 
	  Conrad and fixed by Oliver Feiler.
	
2004-02-28  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.6c
	
	* Fixes Bug 874799 concerning crashing after HTTP redirects.
	  The patch was provided by Oliver Feiler who developed the
	  networking code for his own console client SnowNews.
	* Fixes Bug 869763 - crashing after using "copy link location"
	  and pasting it more than once to any other application.
	* Update to the SnowNews 1.4.3 HTTP client which allows 
	  HTTP authentication. To use this feature simply add 
	  "user:passwd" in front of the domain name of a feeds 
	  URL like "http://user:passwd@www.myblog.com" HTTP 
	  authentication was originally proposed by Søren 
	  Hansen who also wrote a first patch to realize it.
	* The program now supports executing commands to use their
	  results as a feed source. This patch (883388) was proposed 
	  by Johannes Schlueter. To use this feature enter any 
	  shell command starting with a | as the feed URL.
	* Added support for OPML files with lowercase tags 
	  ("xmlurl" instead of "xmlUrl"). AmphetaDesk does 
	  such exports.
	  
2004-01-07  Lars Lindner <lars.lindner@gmx.net>

	Version 0.4.6b
	
	* Fixes bug 872185 (crash on popup menu after

	  program window and subscribe to the dropped URL.
	* Written some more and new text for the Liferea
	  Online Help Feed.
	* Many code improvements and a big patch with 
	  memory leak fixes by Karl Soderstrom.
	* Added a patch from Christophe Barbe to display
	  the count of new item in the folder title.
	* Juho Snellman convinced me that GtkHTML2 does
	  support CSS. So I included his patch and moved
	  the HTML style properties into a style sheet.
	  The user can now create an own style sheet
	  (~/.liferea/liferea.css) to change the styles.
	  
	  THIS CHANGE WILL MAKE ALREADY READ BUT NOT 
	  UPDATED ITEMS UNREAD AGAIN ON THE FIRST UPDATE
	  AFTER THIS UPGRADE. THIS IS NOT A BUG AND IS 
	  DUE TO THE CHANGED HTML CACHE AND WILL HAPPEN 
	  ONLY ONCE.
	  
	* Fixed a bug in the syndication namespace support
	  which caused an default update interval of one day
	  for every feed which uses this namespace. The wrong
	  default interval 'll be automatically fixed after 
	  the next time the feed is updated.
	* Fixes the priority of <summary> vs. <content> tag
	  handling for Atom/Echo/PIE feeds.
	* Fixed the broken tray icon logic.
	* Fixed the loading of non wellformed cache files
	  (this should fix bug 865421 and 861588).
	* Fixed incorrect UTF-8 HTTP URL encoding for Feedster 
	  search feed subscriptions.
	* Fixed bug 858750 (cannot type 't' in search entry
	  reported by José María Mateos)
	* Fixed bug 857386 (crash on subscription without
	  selected folder reported by Jeremy Messenger)
	* Fixed bug 861688 (broken support for lastmodified
	  HTTP header)

	Version 0.4.5

	* favicon.ico support, feeds whose webserver provides
	  a favicon.ico have the standard icon replaced by the
	  favicon.
	* Added the new SnowNews 1.4.1 HTTP client code, which
	  now supports gzip/deflate compression, so Liferea helps
	  saving some bandwidth.
	* Disabled the behaviour of hiding the program window
	  when clicking the tray icon or minimizing, because
	  this caused the window to hide each time the desktop
	  was switched (reported by Dale K. Dicks, Christophe
	  Barbe, Mike Rhodes and others).
	* Added a background shading of read items in the
	  condensed item view as proposed by Mike Rhodes.
	* Added to options to zoom in and out of the HTML view.

	  feed with an unread item like in many mail/news clients.
	* The program now remembers and restores its window size.
	* After updating a feed the program now prints a status bar
