	  'important'. Also updated the 'unread' icon from the
	  GNOME 2.14 stock.

	Version 1.1.0 (Unstable)

	* HTTPS support. (Nathan Conrad)
	* src/ui/eggtrayicon.[ch]: updated from libegg, to fix 
	  the extra spacing between icons. (Rodrigo Moya)
	* Bring mini popups to foreground when updated. 
	  (Scott Harmon)
	* Added CSS style for <del> and <ins> HTML tags.
	  (Jose Maria Mateos)
	* Patch to realize download retries to avoid the 
	  effects of intermediate disconnection. Each
	  download is retried up to 3 times after waiting 30s
	  Retries are only executed after network failures
	  not after HTTP errors. (Thomas de Grenier de Latour)
	* New vfolder rule to match the update status
	  of headlines
	* Liferea now catches SIGTERM and saves the feed list
	  when terminated without using the session manager.

	  offline mode of Liferea. This way offline browsing
	  works correctly. (patch from Don Malcom)
	* Added optional libnotify support. (Norman Jonas)
	* Now read items are instantly removed after 
	  unselecting when browsing folder with "hide read
          items" enabled.
	* The status bar now presents the number of new and
	  unread headlines (Frederic Peter).
	* Rendering is now done using XSLT. This introduces
	  a dependency to libxslt.
	* Makefile improvements (Remi Cardona).
	* With v1.1 the GtkHTML2 rendering module support
	  was dropped. The reason were problems when 
	  rendering XHTML and using Flash applets.
	* With v1.1 the support for OCS and OPML as feed
	  sources was dropped. During the initial import
	  all feeds of this type will be dropped without
	  further notice. Note: OPML as feed list source for 
	  import/export still works.
	* Filter XSLT stylesheet are now applied using 
	  libxslt instead of running xsltproc.

	Bugfixes
