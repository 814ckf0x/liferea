	<h1>Working with Headlines</h1>
	<p>
	After selecting a subscription all headlines (also referred
	as items) of this subscription will appear as a list in
	the right upper pane. If you select an item, its content
	will be displayed in the item view below the item list.
	If you selected the condensed view (two pane mode) 
	Liferea shows all item contents at once ommitting the 
	item list. You can toggle this behaviour by
	selecting "Condensed View" from either the item lists
	or the item views context menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The following text describes all options available for
	the displayed items. <b>Note: Not all of these options
	are available from within the condensed view!</b>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Launching an Item Link</h2>
	<p>
	To open the link the item refers to double click on
	the item or for keyboard users select the item and press
	return. Note that not each item provides a link! If the
	item provides a link the item title text in the item
	views header box is a hyperlink.
	</p>
	<p>
	To learn how to configure the browser that is used
	to open links refer to the "Program Preferences"
	section of this help feed!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Changing the Read Status</h2>
	<p>
	A headline has a read state. Unread items are marked
	bold. If you click on an item the read status changes
	to read and the items list entry text style becomes
	regular. This features also works if you use the keyboard.
	</p>
	<p>
	Sometimes you may not want to read the headlines of a 
	subscription. To mark all unread at once select "Mark all as unread"
	from either the items menu or the context menu of the
	item list.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is also the possibility to change back the item read
	status. Select "Toggle Read Flag" from the items menu or
	click the headline with the third mouse button to achieve this.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Flagging Items</h2>
	<p>
	Liferea allows you to mark items with a flag. This is useful
	to easily find these items and to prevent them from being 
	dropped from the cache when aging. To do so select "Toggle Flag" 
	from the item menu or click the icon column of the headline list
	with the third mouse button. 
	</p>
	<table cellspacing="10">
	<tr><td>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/flag.png">
	</td><td>
	The icon used for flagging items.
	</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<h2>Jump to Next Unread Item</h2>
	<p>
	When using this feature by either clicking the button in the
	toolbar or using the hotkey (Ctrl-N) you will be able to access
	all unread items very fast. The program will first jump to the
	next unread item in the currently displayed item list and when
	there are no unread items it will select the first unread item
	in the first feed of the feed list that contains unread items.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Searching Items</h2>
	<p>
	There is the possibility to search all items which contain
	a specific literal either in their title or their content
	by using the search box. Please refer to the "Searching" 
	section	of this help feed!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Removing Items</h2>
	<p>
	By selecting "Remove All Items" from the items menu you can
	clear the item cache of the currently selected feed. If you
	only want to remove a single by choosing the "Remove Selected"
	option.
