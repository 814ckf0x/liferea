	<h1>Searching and VFolders</h1>
	
	<h2>The Search Dialog</h2>
	<p>
	Liferea supports a simple case sensitive text searching in the item
	content and titles of all feeds and directories. If the search dialog
	is not visible click the search button in the main window toolbar.
	Enter the string you want to search for and press the search button
	rigth of the search entry. Any items containing the string either 
	in their title or their content should appear in the resulting 
	item list.
	</p>

	<p>
	You can also use the GTK search function to search within
	the titles of both the item and the feed list. Press Ctrl-f 
	to activate the	search function and type a search string.
	</p>
	
	<h2>VFolders</h2>
	<p>
	If you want to have permanent searches (e.g. all items containing
	the term "XML") you can create a vfolder which will be added to
	your feed list and contains all items matching this search rule.
	To do so enter your search term into the search box and click
	the search button. After the results appear click the "VFolder"
	button to create a vfolder from the search results. Now a vfolder
	should appear in your feed list. If you want you can edit the
	vfolders title or change its rules by opening the properties
	dialog either from the "Subscriptions" menu or the contextual 
	menu in the feed list.
