	<h1>Program Preferences</h1>

	<p> The preferences dialog can be opened by the toolbar or
	through the "Program" menu. The dialog is divided into two tabs
	described in the following text.  </p>

	<h2>Feeds</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_feeds_0.9.0.png">
	<ul>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Cache Handling:</b> Here you can set the default number 
	of items to be saved for each subscription. Note that this setting
	can be overwritten for each subscription by setting the item cache
	size in the subscriptions properties.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Update Settings:</b> Here you can set the default update
	interval for all subscriptions. If it is set to 0 auto-updating
	is disabled. Note that this setting can be overwritten for each 
	subscription by setting the update interval in the subscriptions 
	properties.<br>
	The option button allows you to control the update behaviour 
	after startup. You have three possibilities:
	<ul>
	<li>Update all out-dated subscriptions.</li>
	<li>Update all subscriptions.</li>
	<li>Don't update subscriptions and reset their update intervals.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Loading Settings:</b> With this option you can influence
	the memory usage of Liferea. You can select wether to keep all
	subscription contents in memory or to load the contents from
	disk when needed.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Folders</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_folders_0.9.0.png">
		
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Folder Display Settings:</b> With this checkbox you can control
	what Liferea loads into the item list when you click a folder.
	The default behaviour is not to change the item list contents. If
	you enable this option all items of all child subscriptions of the
	selected folder are loaded into the item list.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Icons (Favicons):</b> This button allows you to trigger
	an update of all favicons of all subscriptions.
	</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Headlines</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_headlines_0.9.0.png">
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Reading Headlines:</b> Here you can set the hotkey for skimming
	through all unread headlines.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Date Column Settings:</b> Here you can configure the format of
	the date column of the item list. When using the user defined
	option you need to know about the format codes used for this
	feature (experienced users only! please refer to the strftime() 
	manpage).
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Browser</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_browser_0.9.0.png">
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Internal Browser Settings:</b> Here you can configure three
	things. First you can select the browser module to be used to
	render the HTML of the item view. Then you can specify wether
	or not Liferea should open clicked links in the configured 
	external browser or in the item HTML view. The third option
	allows you to switch off Javascript.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>External Browser Settings:</b> When you click links in then 
	item HTML view Liferea launches the a browser command you can
	define with this preferences. The first option button is to
	select your favourite browser or "Manual" for a user defined
	browser command. With the second option button you specify
	how the link is opened inside the previously selected browser.<br>
	Only when selecting "Manual" as browser you can enter a 
	browser command in the command entry. When entering a command
	don't forget to include a <i>"%s"</i> within the command which
	will be replaced with the URL that was clicked. Please keep in 
	mind to double quote the place holder to avoid shell problems 
	with the hash character (#) when launching the browser.<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	If you are using Mozilla you may want to define <i>mozilla "%s"</i>,
	but this will let you launch only the first clicked URL. All following
	URL clicks will launch the Mozilla profile manager. Jim Philips suggested
	the following script to automatically launch URLs in an already existing 
	Mozilla browser window. Save this script to the directory of your choice and
	configure Liferea to launch URLs by calling this script and the URL
	as the first parameter.
	<br>
	<div style="background-color:#F0F0F0;padding:5px;border:dashed 1px black">
	<pre>#!/bin/bash
MOZILLA=/usr/local/bin/mozilla
if ($MOZILLA -remote "ping()"); then
	$MOZILLA -remote "openurl($1, new-tab)"
else
	$MOZILLA $1
fi
</pre>
	</div>
	</p>
	<p><b>Important:</b> Paul Newport reported that Firefox 0.9 changed the -remote
	syntax. Now a <tt>-a firefox</tt> has to be added right before the -remote parameter.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>GUI Settings</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_gui_0.9.0.png">

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Notification Settings:</b> Enable the first checkbox if you 
	want to use the notification area feature. This feature is also 
	known as system tray icon. The program will add a icon to the active 
	notification area application (as provided for GNOME and KDE) which 
	will change when new items arrive and 'll be reset as soon the program 
	is used again. The icon can be used to show the program window if 
	currently hidden or hide the program window if it is visible.<br>
	The second option allows you to enable a notification popup
	window which present a list of the titles of newly headlines
	of updated subscriptions.	
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Menu Settings:</b> Here you can select wether you want to
	display both menu bar and tool bar or only one of them.
	</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Proxy</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_proxy_0.9.0.png">
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>HTTP Proxy Server:</b> Using this preference tab you can
	configure a HTTP proxy for Liferea. If you are a GNOME user
	don't use this tab and configure the proxy in the GNOME
	preference (if not already done).
	</li>
	</ul>
