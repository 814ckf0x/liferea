	<h1>Updating Subscriptions</h1>
	
	<h2>How to update a single subscription</h2>
	<p>
	To update only a single subscriptions select it in the feed list
	and select "Update Feed" or "Update Directory" from the program 
	menu or the contextual menu from within the feed list.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How to update all feeds at once</h2>
	<p>
	To update all subscriptions at once use the "Refresh" button from 
	the toolbar or the option "Update All" from the "Subscriptions"
	menu. Note that this function does not update OCS or OPML directories!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Using Auto Update</h2>
	<p>
	To automatically update all subscriptions you can set a global
	update interval with the resolution of one minute. To do so
	you have to use the preferences dialog. To learn more about
	this refer to the topic "Program Preferences" in this help
	feed.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you like to have some subscriptions to be updated more or
	less frequently than the global default update interval you
	can set an per-subscription update interval in the subscription
	properties. To do so select a subscription from the feed list 
	and select "Properties" from the program menu or the contextual 
	menu. Note: you should not update a feed more often 
	then the content is changing. Think of the web traffic some 
	thousands of clients polling each minute could create!
	</p>
	<p>
	To help with the decision for a good update interval some 
	subscriptions provide an own update interval. When you create a 
	new subscription this value will be set as the default update interval. 
	This setting will overrule the global default update interval. 
	</p>
		
	<div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: OCS and OPML directories are never be auto updated. 
	Directories also won't be updated by the update all function! 
	You have to select "Update Directory" from the contextual menu 
	of the directory entry to update a directory.
	</div>
	
	<h2>Updating all feeds on program startup</h2>
	<p>
	On startup Liferea automatically updates all out-dated subscriptions.
	If you don't like this you can disable this behaviour in the 
	program preferences. To learn more about this refer to the topic 
	"Program Preferences" in this help feed.
