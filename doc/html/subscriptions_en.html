	<h1>Subscribing</h1>
	<p>
	To create a new subscription select "New Feed" from the feed 
	list's contextual menu or the feed menu. A dialog to create a 
	new subscription will appear.
	</p>	
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_subscribe_0.9.0.png">
	<p>
	The data displayed in feeds can be obtained from a variety of
	different sources including over the Internet using a URL, by
	running a command, and by directly reading from a file. The
	source type is selected by clicking one of the three source
	type radio buttons. Usually, a feed is selected by inputting a
	URL, such as "http://slashdot.org/index.rss".
	</p>	
	
	<p>When a command or file type feed is selected, the command
	or file can be selected using a file navigation box by
	clicking "Select File...". When downloading the feed using a
	URL, one can specify a password by clicking the "Use HTTP
	authentication" checkbox and typing the username and password
	in their respective textboxes.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, the data in a feed is in a format that is
	unknown to Liferea. If this is the case, a conversion filter
	can be used to convert the data into a useable format. Many
	filters can be downloaded from <a
	href="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/software/snownews/snowscripts/">the
	Snownews and Liferea script repository</a>.</p>

	<p>To use the filters, one enables the "Conversion filter"
	option and specifies the feed source in the top half of the
	dialog. The filter is specified by either typing the path of
	the filter into the "Convert using" textbox or selecting the
	filter after clicking the "Select File..." button. The filters
	are simple programs that read the original non-supported data
	on stdin and print the valid feed to stdout, and are often
	written using perl. </p>
	
	<p> If the URL is valid and the feed could be loaded, the
	properties dialog used to set additional feed properties will
	appear. This window is described in the next section: "Feed
	Properties".</p>

	<p> Press "Ok" to save your settings and close the feed
	properties dialog. The new feed entry should appear either after
	the selected feed entry or if you had selected a folder, as the
	last item in the folder.</p>



	
	<h1>Feed Properties</h1>
	<p>
	The feed properties window is displayed after creating a new
	feed, when "Properties" is activated in the "Feeds" menu or
	the contextual menu displayed when right-clicking a
	feed. The window groups the properties into four sets: "General",
	"Source", "Feed Cache" and "Authentication".</p>

	<h2>General</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_general_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>The "General" pane allows you to set feed title and update
	interval. The title you can modify here is displayed as the 
	feed name in the feed list. Multiple feeds can have the same title.</p>
	
	<p>Typically you don't need to set an update interval. We
	recommend to use the global update interval preference which
	you can find in the preference dialog. This preference is used
	for all feeds that have the update interval setting to follow
	the global update interval setting.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes a feed provides a feed specific update interval.
	If this is the case Liferea automatically activates the user
	defined update interval setting and enters the feed specific
	update interval. This is done once after subscribing. You
	should never need to change such a setting.</p>
	
	<p>Anyway there might be situations where you want to specify
	a update interval which might be more or less frequent than
	the global update interval. Then you should select the user
	defined interval option and enter the interval value you want.
	<b>When specifying an update interval, you should consider the
	web traffic you will cause with an inappropiate update
	interval. Don't update more often than the feed's content is
	updated.</b></p>
	
	<p>The last update interval option allows you to prevent
	updating the feed. You might use this option for feeds you
	always want to update manually.</p>
	
        <div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: OCS and OPML directories are never updated automatically.
	They can only be updated manually.
	</div>

	<h2>Source</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_source_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>The "Source" pane contains the same fields the "New
	Feed" dialog provided when subscribing to this feed. If you
	want to learn more about them please refer to the previous 
	section "Subscribing".</p>

	<h2>Cache</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_cache_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>The third pane, "Feed Cache", controls how many items of
	a feed are saved when Liferea writes the feeds cache file.
	Similar to the update interval settings there is a 
	corresponding global preference which sets a default cache
	size for all feeds. You should use the feed specific cache
	settings only to implement exceptions from the global
	default cache size.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Default Cache Settings</b> - Makes the feed use the default cache settings, which are stored in the main Liferea
	preferences.</li>
	<li><b>Disable Cache</b> - Disable the feed's items from ever being saved.</li>
	<li><b>Unlimited cache</b> - Save all items. </li>
	<li><b>Limit cache to # items</b> - Limits the cache size to #.</li>
	</ul>
        <div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: Marked items are always saved, regardless of the cache settings.
        </div>
	
	<h2>Authentication</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_auth_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>
	This tab allows you to enable HTTP authentication when downloading
	the feed. Enable the checkbox and enter appropriate user and 
	password values to use this feature.
